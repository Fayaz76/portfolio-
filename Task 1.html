    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p><b>Earth</b> is the third planet from the sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
        This is enabled by Earth being a water world,thr only one in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">solar system</a> sustaining liquid surface water.
        It has a solid and active surface with mountains,valleys,canyons,plains and so much more.<b>Earth</b> is special because it is an ocean planet.water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
        The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land
         is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water together.
        Earth's land is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
        Inside Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation. <br><br><b>Earth</b> has a dynamic 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth">atmosphere</a>,
         which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely
         present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, 
         particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process
          maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic 
          regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate 
          regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.</p>
    <h2>History</h2><hr>
    <p>Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth">History of Earth</a> and Timeline of natural history</p>
    <h3>Formation</h3>
    <i>The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002
        -0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[36] By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[37] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, 
        a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun.
         A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely 
         taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[38]
        
        Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.[39] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized 
        object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[40] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[41][42] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga,
         numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[43].</i>
         <h3>After formation</h3>
         <p>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth">Geological history of Earth</a></p>
         <i>Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[45] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.
            [46] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[47] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70%
             of its current luminosity.[48] By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[49]

            As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition,
             formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust.[50] The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga,
              only 140 Ma after Earth's formation.[51] There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance:[52] (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day,[53]
               which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists,[54][55]
                which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly
                 during the early stages of Earth's history.[56]
            
            New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas
             of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined
              to form Pannotia at 600-540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.[57]
            
            The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma,[58] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma.[59] High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw,
             repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[60] The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the "last ice age", covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.[61]</i>
             <h3>Future</h3>
             <p>Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[78] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate 
                the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100-900 million years.[79][80] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere,
                 making animal life impossible.[81] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect,
                  within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[82] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[82][83]

                The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius.[78][84] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant,
                 the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects,
                  it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[78]</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2><hr>
            <p>The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi),[206] with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi).[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon
                 dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[206] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%[206] but averages about 1%.[3] Clouds cover around two thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land.[207] The height of the troposphere varies
                  with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.[208]

                Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere of today.[64] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly,
                 the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[209] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor,
                  providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[210] This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface,
                   thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the
                    current +15 °C (59 °F),[211] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[212]</p>
            <h2>Geophysical characteristics</h2><hr>
            <b>Further information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics">Geophysics</a></b>
            <h3>Size and shape</h3>
            <p>Earth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium,[85] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.

                Due to Earth's rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its Equator, reaching 43 kilometers (27 mi) further out from its center of mass than at its poles.[86][87] Earth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. Though the largest local variations,
                 like the Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level),[88] only shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%.[n 5][90] Since Earth's surface is farthest out
                  from Earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi) is its farthest point out.[91][92] Parallel to the rigid land topography the Ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.[93]</p>
            <h2>orbit and rotation</h2><hr>
            <h3>Rotation</h3>
            <b>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation">Earth's orbit</a></b>
            <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[154] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms
                 longer than the mean solar day.[155][156]

                Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[2][n 9] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing
                 or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s).[2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[157]
                
                Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the
                 Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.[158][159]</p>
            <h2>Earth-moon system</h2><hr>
            <b>Further information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_system_(astronomy)">Satellite system(astronomy)</a></b>
            <h3>Moon</h3>
            <p>The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto.[171][172]
                 The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.[173] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early 
                 Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.[41]

                The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth.[174] The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.[175]
                 As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases.[176] Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and
                  the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes.[177] During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620 Ma) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.[178]
                
                The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.[179] Some theorists think that without this
                 stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.[180][181]</p>
            <h2>Hydrosphere</h2><hr>
            <b>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere">Hydrosphere</a></b>
            <p>Earth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution. Most of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Nevertheless, Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground
                 waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35*1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated
                  volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi).[189] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi).[190] About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.
                  [191][192] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.[193] The remaining 30% is ground water, 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land)[194] and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere,
                   biological binding, etc. .[195][196]

                In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over
                 land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms.[197] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.[198]
                
                The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[199] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[200] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the
                 survival of many aquatic life forms.[201] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.[20</p>
            <h2>Human geography</h2><hr>
            <b>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography">Human geography</a></b><br> 
            <b>see also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World">World</a></b>   
            <p>Originating from earlier primates in eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land. In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.

                Human population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s,[247] and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century.[248] Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.[248]
                
                Distribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth,[249] partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world's land mass, with 68% of the world's land mass being
                 in the Northern Hemisphere.[250] Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century.[251]
                
                Beyond Earth's surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only special purpose deep underground and underwater presence, and a few space stations. Human population virtually completely remains on Earth's surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half
                 of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.[252][253]</p>
